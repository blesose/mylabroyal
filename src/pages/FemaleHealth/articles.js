    content: `**Introduction**
The menstrual cycle is a natural process in the female body that prepares it for pregnancy. It happens every month and can be understood by girls as young as 8 as a normal monthly rhythm.

**Menstrual Phase (Days 1-5)**
- Shedding of the uterine lining causes bleeding.
- Symptoms: cramps, tiredness, bloating.
**Tips:** Drink water, rest, or try light exercise.

**Follicular Phase (Days 1-13)**
- The ovaries prepare an egg for release.
- Hormones like estrogen rise to help the uterine lining grow.
- Energy levels usually increase during this phase.

**Ovulation (Day 14)**
- The mature egg is released from the ovary.
- Fertile window: about 5 days before and after ovulation.
**Tips:** Track ovulation signs like cervical mucus or body temperature.

**Luteal Phase (Days 15-28)**
- The uterine lining thickens for possible pregnancy.
- If no pregnancy occurs, hormone levels drop, leading to menstruation.
- Symptoms: mood changes, bloating, mild cramps.
**Tips:** Balanced diet and gentle exercise can ease discomfort.`,
